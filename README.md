### Project Overview

This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The core objective is to create a model that can accurately classify a passenger as either a "survivor" or "non-survivor" based on their personal attributes.

To solve this classification problem, a Decision Tree Classifier was chosen. This model is well-suited for the task as it works by creating a series of rules from the data, which makes the decision-making process transparent and easy to interpret. This allows us to not only predict outcomes but also to understand which factors most influenced a passenger's chance of survival.


### Data Sources

The analysis uses a dataset containing key passenger information, including Age, Sex, Social Class, and Port of Embarkation.
